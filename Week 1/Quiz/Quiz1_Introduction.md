**1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.**
**Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a reasonable choice for P?**

* The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.

**2. Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and you would like to predict whether or not it will be raining at 5pm tomorrow. You want to use a learning algorithm for this.**
**Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?**

* Classification

**2. (Alternative Q.) The amount of rain that falls in a day is usually measured in either millimeters (mm) or inches. Suppose you use a learning algorithm to predict how much rain will fall tomorrow.**
**Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem? **

* Regression

**3. Suppose you are working on stock market prediction. You would like to predict whether or not a certain company will win a patent infringement lawsuit (by training on data of companies that had to defend against similar lawsuits). Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?**

* Classification

**3. (Alternative Q.) Suppose you are working on stock market prediction, and you would like to predict the price of a particular stock tomorrow (measured in dollars). You want to use a learning algorithm for this.**
**Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?**

* Regression

**4. Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Which of the following would you apply supervised learning to? (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from.**

* Examine the statistics of two football teams, and predicting which team will win tomorrow's match (given historical data of teams' wins/losses to learn from).

* Given genetic (DNA) data from a person, predict the odds of him/her developing diabetes over the next 10 years.

**5. Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?**

* Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

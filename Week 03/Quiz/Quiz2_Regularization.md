**1. You are training a classification model with logistic regression. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.**

* Adding a new feature to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set.

**2. Suppose you ran logistic regression twice, once with λ = 0, and once with λ = 1. One of the times, you got parameters θ = [26.29, 65.41], and the other time you got θ = [2.75, 1.32]. However, you forgot which value of λ corresponds to which value of θ. Which one do you think corresponds to λ = 1?**

* θ = [2.75, 1.32]

**3. Which of the following statements about regularization are true? Check all that apply.**

* Consider a classification problem. Adding regularization may cause your classifier to incorrectly classify some training examples (which it had correctly classified when not using regularization, i.e. when λ=0).

* Using too large a value of λ can cause your hypothesis to underfit the data.

**4. In which one of the following figures do you think the hypothesis has overfit the training set?**

* The plot where the fitted line in the graph overlaps each point.

**5. In which one of the following figures do you think the hypothesis has underfit the training set?**

* The plot where the fitted line in the graph don't overlaps each point.
